# AdoptABudy Backend 

This is a Ruby on Rails based API that is designed to be integrated with the AdoptABuddy frontend, which is a user interface built with React-Redux that allows users to search for adoptable animals in their area. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database and also interacts with the Petfinder API.

## Installation 

Fork and clone this repo onto your computer. 
Install dependencies: `bundle install`
Setup the database: 
```
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

This application uses the Petfinder API, which requires an API key. Instructions on how to get an API key can be found [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/)
Once you have your key you will need to make a .env file in the root directory and create a global variable, TOKEN, which contains your credentials. Make sure this file is added to your gitignore file.

## Usage 

The AdoptABuddy front end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mlcomeau/AdoptABuddy-frontend) and include installation instructions. Once that is complete run `rails s` to start the API
